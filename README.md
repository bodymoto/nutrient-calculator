A prototype app and the first iteration of my [Nutritional Food Graph](https://github.com/boshimoto/nutritional-food-graph).<br/>
Using a limited data set of approx 200 food objects a user can calculate a meals nutritional value for making healthier life choices. Originally inspired to help aid in keto dieting.<br/>
Supports filtering by food group.<br/>
Users add or remove different foods listed and later calculate their totals.<br/>
<br/>
My first **TESTED** project, using Open-WC and Web Test Runner, as recommended by the Lit documentation.<br/>
To launch the test suite, run: ```npm run test```
<br/><br/>
This project boasts an event-up, properties-down approach -- each components lives isolated from one another within the shadow DOM and runs independently of the parent/child relationship. Completely framework agnostic!<br/>
