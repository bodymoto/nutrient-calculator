The app allows users to filter foods by category, select food choices that match their meal portion size, and calculate the total intake of macronutrients and micronutrients. It utilizes a custom dataset of around 200 food objects with nutritional data and is powered by Web Components.<br/>
This project was inspired by my goal to enhance and iterate on my [food-nutrition-graph](https://github.com/boshimoto/food-nutrition-graph)<br/>
