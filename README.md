A prototype app and the first iteration of my [Nutritional Food Graph](https://github.com/boshimoto/nutritional-food-graph).<br/>
<br/>
Using a limited data set of approx 200 food objects a user can calculate a meals nutritional value for making healthier life choices. Originally inspired to help aid in keto dieting.<br/>
<br/>
Supports filtering by food group.<br/>
Users add or remove different foods listed and later calculate their totals.<br/>
<br/>
This project boasts an event-up, properties-down approach -- each components lives isolated from one another within the shadow DOM and runs independently of the parent/child relationship. And is completely framework agnostic!<br/>
<br/>
Inspired, I've set out to further iterate on this idea with [bodyboon.com](https://bodyboon.com)!
